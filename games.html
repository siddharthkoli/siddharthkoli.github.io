            I've been playing video games since I was a kid. They are the reason I got into programming in the first place! I stil enjoy gaming, however it's difficult to manage gaming along with work and building stuff.
            I almost exclusively play single player, story driven games, with the exception of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_2/" target="_blank">CS:GO</a> and <a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/" target="_blank">Rocket League</a>.

            <br><br>
            These are some of them I've thoroughly enjoyed. They are in no specific order, although I plan to sort them by some metric soon.

        <ul>
            <li><b>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</b> — My all time favorite game. Fantastic story writing, great gameplay, interesting and non-traditional side quests. Have done 3 playthroughs of this myself. First game that pops up in my mind when asked about games.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Red Dead Redemption 2</b> — Incredible story with well written and thought out characters. It has a slow gamplay, which allows you to indulge into its massive world and all of its minute details. Sure, it takes a dive in quality nearing the last third of the story, but that's still better than most games nowadays.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Factorio</b> — THE FACTORY MUST GROW! That's all I can say.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</b> — Satisfying parry mechanic that requires skill some skill that develops with some practice. Rewards the patient. Also the first game where I tried speedrunning!</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Metro: Exodus</b> — Not like your regular shooter where you carry 10 guns and a tank in one of your pockets, while the other pocket has a hospital ER department to heal you. You have to decide whether you even be engaging an enemy, and when you do, you are counting bullets as you shoot. Resources are scarce, and you can only craft some measly ones while in a shootout. Meaningful crafting can only be done at crafting tables. Great characters that you'll remember even after finishing the game.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Batman: Arkham Series</b> — FreeFlow combat go brrrr!</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Titanfall 2</b> — Platformer/Shooter that has more creativity, variations and innovation in a single level than most games have in their entire span of the game. Touching story too.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>God of War</b> — Incredible acting and spectacular, jaw dropping boss fights accompanied by a gripping story. Leaves you on a cliffhanger moment at the end.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Stardew Valley</b> — Pixel adventure / Farming Sim / Life Sim? Addictive gameplay loop where you'll keep saying: "Just one more day". Tons of content, secrets to explore, story branches to traverse. Can't believe it's made by a single dev!</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Skyrim</b> — Excellent example of how a community can keep a game alive when you let them go nuts with mods. You can practically do everything in Skyrim.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>The Portal Series</b> — Brilliant puzzle platformer. Innovtive gameplay loop. Engaging story. Stephen Merchant and JK Simmons was an added bonus.</li>
